The browser in sforzando is difficult to use when managing large libraries or SF2 soundfonts, but allows dragging in instrument files. This application reads the sforzando library folder and provides an alternate user interface from which you can drag instruments into sforzando.

## Requirements

Built using SwiftUI and SwiftData, requires macOS 14.0 Sonoma or higher.
